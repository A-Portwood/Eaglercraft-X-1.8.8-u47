<b>Eaglercraft 1.8.8 javascript runtime.</b>

I'LL BE UPLOADING NEW VERSIONS EACH UPDATE SO LOOK OUT FOR THEM!

 Multiplayer worlds available. Customizable profile, skins, settings, and controls. Game modes including creative, survival, peaceful, and more! Villages, mine shafts, dungeons, caves, ravines, many different biomes, and other things can spawn. The Nether and End are also available. Commands are the same as the real Minecraft. <b>This version of 1.8.8 has both Multiplayer and Singleplayer, so export your worlds from 1.5.2 using EPK or Vanilla formats!</b>

<h1>Servers</h1>
Go to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dz7OAYckd_oea3qUHkRYtT4eZVZjuQalIUKyZ3ZFaEA/edit?usp=sharing"<a>this doc<a> to get <b>a list of Multiplayer Server Addresses.</b> I currently own it and will make any updates if needed.
</p>

<h1>IMPORTANT!</h1>

<p>
When you create a new world, it will be a black screen, or you may have spawned underground. <b>ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT 1–5 MINUTES!</b> It will fix on its own. It will also be laggy at first, but it will smooth out after 5–10 minutes. <b>Keep in mind that this is an old version of Minecraft and that not everything in the real current Minecraft will be avialable.</b>
